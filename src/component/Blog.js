                            Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a "preflight" request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.

                            The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client. When we build cross-platform apps with our Apple platforms, Android, and JavaScript SDKs, all of your clients share one Realtime Database instance and automatically receive updates with the newest data

                            Node.js is the JavaScript runtime environment which is based on Googleâ€™s V8 Engine i.e. with the help of Node.js we can run the JavaScript outside of the browser. Other things that you may or may not have read about Node.js is that it is single-threaded, based on event-driven architecture, and non-blocking based on the I/O model
